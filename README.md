# odin-recipes

This project was for The Odin Project and the index.html file is essentially a recipe list that leads to 3 recipes. I decided to do tacos, mac and cheese, and cheeseburgers. It's not the best I could have done it, but I was mostly trying to focus on getting the right stuff done correctly. It is very satisfying to refresh the page once you have saved your updates and see it all work.

Thanks to all who contributed to The Odin Project! I'm loving it so far.
