        <h2>How to make beef tacos</h2>
        <p>These tacos are simple yet flavorous. They require no more ingredients

        are so delicious and filling. Just don't eat too many, even if you struggle not
        to!</p>
        <p>This taco recipe should be able to make 6 tacos.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Crunchy taco shells</li>
            <li>1 lbs of ground beef</li>
            <li>Pre-bought or your own taco beef seasoning</li>
            <li>One half of a red, green, and yellow bell pepper.</li>
            <li>Half an onion</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, guacamole &#40;guacamole optional&#41;</li>
            <li>Shredded cheddar cheese &#40;minimum of 10oz but the choice is yours. Optional too.&#41;</li>
            <li>Sour cream and salsa &#40;both optional&#41;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 2tsp olive oil into a pan and once ready, place in your ground beef
            and begin breaking up the ground beef with a rubber spatula until browned.</li>
            <li>Once the ground beef is browned, enter in the onion and peppers and let them
            cook in the beef, then put in the taco beef seasoning and stir the mix well.</li>
            <li>Using an oven or microwave, heat the taco shells so that they soften, because
            trust me, you they aren't that nice cold and they break easily if cold.</li>
            <li>Now that the shells and beef are ready, put the right amount of beef in the tacos,
            put the shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on top of the beef with some shredded 
            cheddar cheese &#40;if you want some&#41;, along with some salsa and/or sour cream. </li>
            <li>There we go, your tacos are done! You can have anything you want as a side, it's
            up to you!</li>
        </ol>
