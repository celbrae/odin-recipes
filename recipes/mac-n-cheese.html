        <h2>How to make mac and cheese</h2>
        <p>Mac and cheese is proof that food doesn't need to be extravagant and complex in
        order to taste amazing. This recipe does exactly that, and only requires a few ingredients
        besides the macaroni.</p>
        <p>This recipe serves 2 people</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of cheddar cheese &#40;but lets be serious, you can't have too much cheese&#41;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, get the macaroni to a boil on the stove for around 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Begin the roux making part by melting some butter in a pot on the stove. Not too
            high a heat as we don't want it burning.</li>
            <li>Gradually add flower bit by bit until the roux turns into a thick brownish paste.</li>
            <li>Now, pour the milk bit-by-bit ensuring there are no lumps in the sauce. I recommend
            adding some salt, pepper, and paprika at this point. Let the sauce simmer for 2-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Somewhere around this point, your macaroni should be finished cooking. If your sauce is
            done, drain the macaroni and pour it into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Now add as much cheddar as you like into the macaroni and let it all melt together.</li>
            <li>And that's it! The great thing about Mac and Cheese it's highly customizable. If you
            want to, you can add differernt types of cheese, bacon, bake it, whatever comes to mind!</li>
        </ol>
