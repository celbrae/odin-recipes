        <h2>How to make a cheeseburger</h2>
        <p>Cheeseburgers are probably one of the most popular foods in the world. Cheeseburgers haven't
        actually been around for too long compared to other foods like pizza, but nearly enough
        every fast food joint revolves around or feature cheeseburgers!
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, enough cheeseburger praise, let's get to making them! This recipe makes 4 burgers.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>4 cheddar cheese slices</li>
            <li>Shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, onion, pickles, and condiments of your choice</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shape your ground beef into patties and season nicely with some salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on a heated pan with oil for a few minutes before flipping.</li>
            <li>When ready to flip, do so and place a cheddar cheese slice on each patty.</li>
            <li>Begin toasting your buns either on a separate pan or under a grill.</li>
            <li>Once the patties and buns are done, put your condiments of choice on the
            buns, and then put the patties on the bottom buns. Add lettuce, pickles, tomatoes,
            and onions &#40;if you're having those&#41; and then put on the top buns.</li>
            <li>And there we are! 4 simple hamburgers all made within 10 minutes and ready
            to eat without utensils. The thing is about hamburgers is not only can you eat
            them anywhere, but you can put whatever you like on them to such as bacon or an
            egg &#40;if you want to go crazy&#41;. Enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
